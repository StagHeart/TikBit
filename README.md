# TikBit
This is a site I wrote in Python with the Django framework. It takes advantage of Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. It was a catch all for news on my current projects as well as information about my software development services. I gutted all the private info. I change some names, I completely removed some files like production.py for obvious reason. But this will give you an idea on how get Python, Django, JavaScript, and jQuary to all work in harmony.  This project will have good examples on how to implement:  1) Mobile-first design 2) Sign ups 3) Storing user data 4) jQuery pie charts 5) embedded a Youtube video 6) Handling errors 7) Responsive UI and handling screen size changes
